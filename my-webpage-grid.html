            The Fourth Industrial Revolution is a way of describing the blurring of boundaries between the physical,
            digital, and biological worlds.
            It’s a fusion of advances in artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, the Internet of Things (IoT), 3D
            printing, genetic engineering, quantum computing, and other technologies.
            It’s the collective force behind many products and services that are fast becoming indispensable to
            modern life. Think GPS systems that suggest the fastest route to a destination,
            voice-activated virtual assistants such as Apple’s Siri, personalized Netflix recommendations, and
            Facebook’s ability to recognize your face and tag you in a friend’s photo.

            Agile acquisition is the strategy, structure, and process to effectively adopt and apply agile software
            development methodologies.
            Agile acquisition integrates planning, design, development, and testing into an iterative life cycle to
            deliver small, frequent, incremental capabilities to an end user.
            Rapid is about tailoring, delegating and going fast. Rapid refers to critical thinking and scheduling
            associated with a program team navigating an acquisition pathway spectrum
            from strategy development through program execution in order to expedite delivering capability into the
            hands of the developer.
